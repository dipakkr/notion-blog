            sharing new ideas. I'm also very passionate about building a
            business that has a great impact on society.

              we built a community of 10k students across 50+ campuses across

            We had product, we had community, but we were not clear about our

          <p>
            I then worked with multiple startup like
            <b> FluxAuto, 91wheels, and Airmeet(now)</b> to build software
            products. With this blog, I am trying to develop a more consistent
            habit of writing online and sharing my thought and experiments.
